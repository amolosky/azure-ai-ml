# Azure Machine Learning and AI Exercises
25+ full examples for getting started (or leveling up) your Azure AI and Machine Learning skills
## Getting Started
**To get started with Azure Machine Learning exercises, you can follow these steps to find the necessary documentation and resources**
 1. Azure Machine Learning Documentation: The official Azure Machine Learning documentation is a comprehensive resource that covers everything from basic concepts to advanced scenarios. You can start here: [Azure Machine Learning documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/?view=azureml-api-2).
 2. Quickstarts and Tutorials: The documentation includes a variety of quickstarts and tutorials that are great for getting hands-on experience. Look for sections titled "Quickstarts" and "Tutorials" within the documentation.
 3. Microsoft Learn: Microsoft Learn offers interactive learning paths and modules that are specifically designed for Azure Machine Learning. These can be very helpful for beginners and cover both the theoretical aspects and practical exercises. Start with the Azure Machine Learning fundamentals on Microsoft Learn: [Introduction to Azure Machine Learning](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/get-started-with-artificial-intelligence-on-azure/).
 4. GitHub Repositories: Microsoft and the community often publish sample projects and exercises on GitHub. You can search for Azure Machine Learning repositories for sample code and projects. A good starting point is the [Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks repository](https://github.com/Azure/MachineLearningNotebooks), which provides examples and best practices.
 5. Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python: If you're planning to use Python for Azure Machine Learning, the SDK documentation is invaluable. It includes API references, sample code, and guides: [Azure Machine Learning SDK for Python](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/?view=azure-ml-py).
 6. Community Forums and Support: Engaging with the Azure Machine Learning community can be very helpful. You can ask questions, share experiences, and get advice from other users on forums like Stack Overflow, the Microsoft Azure forums, or the MSDN forums.
 7. Azure Machine Learning Studio: For a more visual approach, explore the Azure Machine Learning Studio, which allows you to build, test, and deploy machine learning models using a drag-and-drop interface. It's a great way to get started without writing much code.
